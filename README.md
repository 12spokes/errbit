Errbit: The open source self-hosted Hoptoad Server
=====================================================

Installation
------------

*Note*: This app is intended for people with experience deploying and maintining
Rails applications. If you're uncomfortable with any step below then Errbit is not
for you. Checkout [Hoptoad](http://hoptoadapp.com) from the guys over at 
[Thoughbot](http://thoughtbot.com), which Errbit is based on.

**Set your local box or server(Ubuntu):**

  1. Install MongoDB
    * Follow the directions [here](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Ubuntu+and+Debian+packages) then:
      
            aptitude update
            aptitude install mongodb
      
  2. Install libxml
    
        apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
        
  3. Install Bundler
  
         gem install bundler --pre
         
**Running Locally:**

  1. Bootstrap Errbit. This will copy over config.yml and also seed the database.

        rake errbit:bootstrap

  2. Update the config.yml and mongoid.yml files with information about your environment
  3. Install dependencies
  
        bundle install
      
  4. Start Server
  
        script/rails server

**Deploying:**

  1. Bootstrap Errbit. This will copy over config.yml and also seed the database.

        rake errbit:bootstrap

  2. Update the deploy.rb file with information about your server
  3. Setup server and deploy
        
        cap deploy:setup deploy

TODO
----

* Add a deployment view
* Add ability for watchers to be configured for types of notifications they should receive

Contributing
------------
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
